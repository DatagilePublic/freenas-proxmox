Their donations have allowed for:
- A 4 Node Proxmox VE Cluster for testing and development.
  - Spin up old and new revisions of FreeNAS and TrueNAS.
- 10Gb Ethernet Testing.
- Multihomed configuration testing.
  - In progress and as best I can in a flat network.

## Roadmap
<details><summary>Roadmap details</summary>

* Update the documentation - <i>In Progress</i>.
  * Restructure the main README.md for better readability. 
  * Add some screenshots.
* Fix Max Lun Limit issue.
  * https://github.com/TheGrandWazoo/freenas-proxmox/issues/150
* Fix automated builds - <i>In Progress</i>.
  * Production - 'main' repo component.
* Autoinstall the SSH keys.
  * Tech spike to see if it is even doable.
* Hashicorp Vault integration.
  * Pull in secrets from a Hashicorp Vault service.  
  * Tech spike to see if it is even doable.
* Package the patches with the deb package.
  * Remove the need for git dependency.
* Change to LWP::UserAgent
  * Remove dependency of the REST::Client because LWP::UserAgent is already installed and used by Proxmox VE.
* Change from FreeNAS to TrueNAS - <i>In Progress</i>.
  * Cleanup the FreeNAS repo and name everything to TrueNAS to be inline with the product.
* Add API key for direct TrueNAS services - <i>In Progress</i>.
  * Will be a new enable field and API key and will only be used by the plugin.
  * You will still need the SSH keys, username, and password because of Proxmox VE using `iscsiadm` to get the list of disks.
    * This is tricky because the format needs to be that of the output of 'zfs list' which is not part of the LunCmd but that of the backend Proxmox VE system and the API's do a bunch of JSON stuff.

<details><summary>Step 2.0: Next step after completing any combination of the 1.x steps</summary>

## Uninstall truenas-proxmox

<details><summary>If you wish not to use the package you may remove it at anytime with the following:</summary>

  apt [remove|purge] freenas-proxmox
 ```

 This will place you back to a normal and non-patched Proxmox VE install.
 
</details>

## Notes:

### Please be aware that this plugin uses the TrueNAS APIs but still uses SSH keys due to the underlying Proxmox VE perl modules that use the ```iscsiadm``` command.

You will still need to configure the SSH connector for listing the ZFS Pools because this is currently being done in a Proxmox module (ZFSPoolPlugin.pm). To configure this please follow the steps at https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Storage:_ZFS_over_iSCSI that have to do with SSH between Proxmox VE and TrueNAS. The code segment should start out `mkdir /etc/pve/priv/zfs`.

1. Remember to follow the instructions mentioned above for the SSH keys.

2. Refresh the Proxmox GUI in your browser to load the new Javascript code.

3. Add your new TrueNAS ZFS-over-iSCSI storage using the TrueNAS-API.

4. Thanks for your support.
